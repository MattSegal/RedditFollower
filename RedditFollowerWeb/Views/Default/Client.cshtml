There is still another path for any modern scientist who has acquired a reputation: it leads toward Washington, the affairs of state, national secrets, and the unscientific intricacies of government. In and out of the intellectuals' Cosmos Club on Washington's Massachusetts Avenue hurry physicists, chemists and mathematicians newly arrived to huddle with generals, admirals, high officials of the Federal Government, even, occasionally, the President himself. \""There are three kinds of physicists.\"" says AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss, \""theoretical, applied and political.\"" Edward Teller is all three.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the Atomic Energy Commission's Livermore, Calif, fusion laboratory, Teller turns his mind to development of tactical-size, low-fallout thermonuclear weapons. In addition, he serves on the AEC's General Advisory Committee and the Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board, carries on his own strenuous public education campaign in media as far afield from pure science as the This Week Sunday supplement. Main topics: the survival value of underground bomb shelters, the need for continued nuclear-weapons tests, and, above all, the urgency of keeping ahead of Russia in science.\n&gt; \n&gt; Multiple Monomania. With all this, plus university duties as an associate director of the Radiation Laboratory and a teacher of postgraduate physics. Teller's life shows scant resemblance to the stereotype of the scientist at work, insulated from the clamors and interruptions of the outside world. Even before Teller leaves his garden-girdled house in Berkeley in the morning, his harried secretary usually puts through two or three long-distance calls. After he gets to his office, a train of thought about some theoretical problem in nuclear physics is likely to be interrupted by a query from the Pentagon or a reminder that it is time to leave for the San Francisco airport to catch an outgoing plane. On his trips to the AEC's Livermore lab, 45 miles from Berkeley, Teller dictates letters to his secretary while driving. *It is no wonder that Teller has not found time to finish the atomic alphabet (see box) that he started writing for his two youngsters.*\n&gt; \n&gt; Teller's hectic schedule has damaged his health: suffering from ulcerative colitis, he takes daily doses of atropine and phenobarbital, sticks to a doctor-ordered diet, painful for a man who devours food with Hungarian gusto. But a damaged constitution has not damped his crusader's fervor. The late great Nuclear Physicist Enrico Fermi once said to him, with affectionate exasperation: \""In my acquaintance, you are the only monomaniac with several manias.\"" Princeton Physicist John Wheeler, who worked on both the A-bomb and the H-bomb, put it more truly. The essence of Teller's character, Wheeler said recently, is that he \""cares very much.\""\n&gt; \n&gt; A Lost War. Edward Teller's intense concern with the menace of tyranny traces back to his Hungarian childhood. When Teller was born, in 1908, into a Jewish family with culture and money, citizens of gay, well-fed Budapest could believe that the world was solid, dependable. But Austria-Hungary got into World War 1 on the losing side, and the seemingly solid world crumbled. Defeated Hungary lost two-thirds of its prewar territory, and the country's economy collapsed in wild inflation. With the nation's life disrupted and anti-Semitism rampant, Teller's father dinned into his son two grim lessons: 1) he would have to emigrate to some more favorable country when he grew up, and 2) as a member of a disliked minority he would have to excel the average just to stay even.\n&gt; \n&gt; \""All this has great relevance to me,\"" says Teller. \""I have seen, in Hungary, at least one society that was once healthy go completely to the dogs. I have seen the consequences of a lost war. I have also seen very many people, with all the evidence before them, refuse to believe what they saw.\""\n&gt; \n&gt; The Square. It was easy enough for young Edward to excel the average. In early childhood he showed a gift for mathematics. \""One of my earliest memories,\"" he recalls, \""is that I was put to bed earlier than I liked and then lay awake in the dark, amusing myself by figuring how many seconds there were in a minute, an hour, a day.\""\n&gt; \n&gt; In his high-school days in Budapest, Teller was, as he puts it today, a \""square\"" (pronounced, in his thick accent, \""skvare\""). Favorite amusements were chess, hiking, poetry and music. Among the subjects of his poems was a chum's brainy, grey-eyed younger sister, Mici (pronounced Mitzi), who shared young Teller's enthusiasm for mathematics and that special Hungarian passion, ping-pong. Eventually they were married. ...\n\nThere is no 'box' included in the HTML version; the entry before is \""The Week's Pause\"" (about Eisenhower) and the next entry is \""BRIGHT SPECTRUM\"" (about several other physicists like Seaborg and Feynman but nothing about Teller's alphabet). \""Knowledge is Power\"" turns out to be the only hit in EBSCOhost for `Teller AND \""atomic alphabet\"" [TX All Text]`.

If the user is watching a video, that gives you several minutes to train anything you want, but at least at the beginning, presumably they are rapidly rejecting videos. You could do something like train models in threads and generate predictions from the most recent model to finish training; then newly-ranked videos get added to the dataset, and new models spun up; this would let you use (smaller) random forests... But online random forests is probably better (with maybe a 'batch mode' which gets invoked to produce a final high-quality model once the user finishes a session, since I would expect online random forests to perform a bit worse due to being online).""},{""id"":""d4pb96q"",""link_id"":""t3_4pvv66"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":1,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466993188,""body"":""For those of us not familiar with sklearn, what sort of modeling is this doing and what do the error rates look like over time?""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4pvv66/what_happens_when_i_combine_my_love_of_machine/""},{""id"":""4pukbl"",""is_self"":false,""subreddit"":""neuroscience"",""author"":""Lightfiend"",""score"":31,""num_comments"":19,""permalink"":""/r/neuroscience/comments/4pukbl/where_will_all_the_new_neuroscientists_go_leaders/"",""created_utc"":1466891212,""title"":""Where Will All the New Neuroscientists Go? - \""Leaders in the field highlight the need for new career paths to accommodate a flood of PhDs\"",""url"":""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/talking-back/where-will-all-the-new-neuroscientists-go/"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4oeggy"",""link_id"":""t3_4pukbl"",""author"":""The_Amp_Walrus"",""score"":3,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466924843,""body"":""Is it uninteresting because it is well-understood, or is it uninteresting for other reasons?""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/4pukbl/where_will_all_the_new_neuroscientists_go_leaders/""},{""id"":""4ptsca"",""is_self"":false,""subreddit"":""webdev"",""author"":""alinrauta"",""score"":19,""num_comments"":16,""permalink"":""/r/webdev/comments/4ptsca/myths_of_learning_to_code/"",""created_utc"":1466880217,""title"":""Myths of learning to code"",""url"":""https://medium.com/from-a-self-taught-programmer-to-another/the-myths-of-learning-to-code-fa8e4f887821#.suzye0x22"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4oezt9"",""link_id"":""t3_4ptsca"",""author"":""The_Amp_Walrus"",""score"":2,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466926670,""body"":""Let's break this list down and make it less scary:\n\n&gt; Myth: You can monetise your basic programming skills very early\n\nI'm not sure where this one came from but it's basically true unless you are quite entrepreneurial.

I don't know your situation, but it would be wise to have either some savings, or a source of income while you're learning to code.\n\n&gt; Myth: You will quickly find a programming job because is huge demand in the market\n\nThis one is silly. The world is a big place and there isn't a single global market for programmers. The author, nor me, does not know where you live or what your local job market is like.

That said it would be wise to investigate the job market.\n\n&gt; Myth: Having a degree in CS is not very important\n\nMost entry-level software dev jobs ads I read (in Melbourne, AUS) read 'Computer Science degree *or equivalent*'. You just need to demonstrate that you have the equivalent part. Part of that is knowing practical things like a language and web framework, and another part is theory. Learn a bit about algos and data structures and learn a bit about how communication over the web works. It's totally do-able and if you're just looking to learn enough to get employed it won't take you four years. It's probably hard to get a job writing an in-game physics engine in C++ without a CS degree, but web development has a lower barrier for entry degree wise.\n\n&gt; Myth: After a couple of tutorials you’ll be up and running\n\nYou will not be up and running after a couple of tutorials. You will need to do a few tutorials, do some personal projects, read and research, do a couple more tutorials, read and research some more, do some more personal projects, and then after a while you'll be up and running. The more time you spend learning to program, the better you will get at learning to program as well. You never really stop learning though.\n\n&gt; Myth: Learning programming alone is not so bad\n\nThis is totally subjective but if you really have trouble try to solve the problem rather than just give up.

But it doesn't make the image look any better, it just gets blurrier and bigger. (Which is fine in its own way; at one point a generator was creating this very trippy red fire background noise and it looked even cooler when upscaled to wallpaper size.)\n\nSecond, it's a mix of it being harder and slower. You can make DCGAN-Torch work on 128px input images by simply adding another layer to the generator and discriminator, and train as usual. The downside is training performance and stability: RAM consumption goes up even further and minibatches get smaller and slower (why does everyone downscale ImageNet? same reason); but much more problematically, divergence increases so it's harder to tune the size of the discriminator and generators so neither 'wins' and ruins training. The upside is, at least in the runs I was doing before I ran into out-of-RAM errors (something in DCGAN-Torch would spike RAM consumption after a few epoches) or training diverged, is that more details are visible in the input to the GAN to learn from (64px is just hilariously small) and the generated sample outputs *did* look noticeably better.

What do you do to hedge effectively against this risk? Most importantly, what would you differently with this information than with none?\n\nI always have information and priors, implicit in my actions. For example, if I had, in running my fund, taken out no long positions on non-pound currencies but remained entirely in pounds, I have implicitly expressed the belief that I am the most optimistic about the pound and expect with near-zero probability a Brexit (as indeed most people seem to have regarded it and why Cameron was willing to stake his career on it). If a trusted information source increases a huge disruptive event to as much as 10%, then I ought to take out counter-measures. Which counter-measures will depend on the exact details of my portfolio and how much they cost and my current estimates of the risk and the ensuing losses, and this is a major topic of financial theory. (Taleb never disputes, as you do, that one *can* hedge and offset risks, and explicitly admits that this can be done all the time in a sensible way in 'Mediocristan'; his point is that the heavy tailed, sometimes power-law distributions, which exist in some contexts, combined with gambler's ruin, mean that the optimal portfolio there should be structured differently than the simplest expected-value approaches. Which I am not sure why he finds so revolutionary since the difference between expected-value and something like the Kelly criterion has been understand since at least the '50s, and bringing in fat tails doesn't change that much.)\n\n&gt; If an event has a 10% chance of happening, which is non-negligible, you'd guess asset managers would have been prepared to it.\n\nFirst, an event either happens or it doesn't. No matter what happens, one is exposed to downsides: if you spend money buying options or hedges, then if Brexit doesn't happen, you're out that money, and if you don't, then you're out other possibly larger amounts of money when it does; you profit by calibrating your expenses based on the losses of each scenario and the changing probabilities, and slowly doing better on average than your peers by weathering inevitable risks at lower cost.\n\nAnd either way, the markets are going to move; they react to reductions in uncertainty and new information, and the actual results were a lot of information. Even if the results could be forecast with 95% confidence, that last 5% can still roil the markets when it's definitively resolved. That's how efficient markets work. \n\n&gt; What do you do differently with no information and \""this equipment has a 0.08% chance of failure\""? Chances are, you'll allocate exactly the same amount of resources to maintenance of the equipment. Because even a 0.001% probability is too big a risk to take\n\nAbsolutely wrong. You certainly will not reason the same. 0.08% is a catastrophic risk of failure if it's in a vital piece of equipment like the jet engine. The FAA grounds airplane fleets for far smaller risks of failures. If there really was a piece of airplane equipment with 0.08% failure on an annual basis, that alone would blow the entire US aviation industry's accident rate for that year. Think about the consequences: a jetplane can carry 300+ passengers, each of whom has a statistical value of life at ~$10m and whose survivors can and will sue for hundreds of millions of dollars, in addition to the losses from people being scared of your airline, your insurers jacking up your premiums, and the lengthy FAA investigation damning you for innumeracy and depraved indifference to life. On the other hand, less important stuff like the software systems... we could wish for a world in which they had failure rates as low as 0.08%. So a 0.001% risk of failure in a less important component may be perfectly acceptable, especially if it has multiple redundancies and is regularly inspected by the mechanics for hints that that 0.001% failure is going to happen, and the pace of those inspections (which after all, cost money) can be adjusted based on the risk and outcome of the loss. This is why big efforts are put into part and machine testing so the probability failures and time-to-failures can be quantified precisely and parts' working lifetimes logged and taken out of service before they reach sufficiently-high risk of future failure. Decisions are made based on probabilities and utilities. A 1% risk might be enough to pay a fortune for prevention in one context; and absolutely trivial and irrelevant in another.  Posterior probabilities are not effect sizes are not utilities are not profits are not decisions.\n\n&gt; I hope that as PMs become ever more widely used, predictions are ever more accurate and close to a boolean. That's not an indictment of PMs; that's how they're supposed to work. The more users, the more accuracy. I don't want vague predictions; I want to know the future.\n\nToo bad. You never will. All a PM or any market, even infinitely liquid ones, can tell you is what peoples' best estimate is. And almost all of the time, on topics of interest, that is *neither 1 nor 0*. This is why prices move. Always there is new information. As Yoda might say, 'difficult to see, is the future. Always in motion it is.'""},{""id"":""d4msdjm"",""link_id"":""t3_4pkya1"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":2,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466803936,""body"":""&gt; God, were the Greeks and Romans dumb! All these efforts to get booleans via oracles and auguries, when they just could have asked for a probability\n\nYes, they should have. A boolean is not that useful. A probability is better, and a full distribution even better still. If they had had better statistics, they would have used them. Oddly, I don't believe the Greeks and Romans represent the pinnacle of human thought and cannot be surpassed.\n\n&gt; Your contempt of Taleb is not uncommon, but sad, as you're losing tremendous amounts of wisdom. \n\nI have read Taleb. What he says in general is highly debatable and I don't see how it's particularly relevant here. Perhaps you could explain in more detail why Taleb proves that prediction markets should never be right, and what exactly you mean by claims like 'Under the 50% threshold, probabilities exponentially become useless information.' \n\n&gt; Probabilities below .51 are mostly useless and sometimes even dangerous for actual human decision-making (false sense of security encouraged by the cost of hedging). \n\nI don't even know what it means to denigrate 'probabilities below .51'. That's like saying that numbers are useless if they are bigger than '51'. If a probability is expressed on a daily basis rather than yearly, does that suddenly make it nonsensical? If the chance of getting cancer is less than 51%, does that mean you'll never get cancer?\n\n&gt; But I sure hope we'll get more useful intel than \""maybe yes, maybe no\"".\n\nWhat they will give you is exactly what they say on the tin: as the market becomes larger and more efficient, over all events considered in the markets at price X, ~X% of them will happen. It's always saying 'maybe yes', with 'maaaybe' drawn out more or less depending on the view of the market.\n\nIf you don't believe there's a difference between 50% and 99%, perhaps you should go back to Greek and Roman methods of predictions like young girls huffing cave fumes.""},{""id"":""d4md64t"",""link_id"":""t3_4pkya1"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":1,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466783659,""body"":""&gt; Then they are useless.

Personally I enjoy the maths, but you couldn't get me to learn about WCF with a gun to my head unless I was working on a WCF project.\n   \n[Relevant article](http://prog21.dadgum.com/190.html)\n&gt; Every so often I see someone attempting to learn a skill (e.g., web design, game development, songwriting), by finishing a project every day/week/month. I love these! They're exciting and inspirational and immediate. What a great way to learn! The first projects are all about getting something--anything--working. That's followed by re-engineering familiar designs. How to implement Snake, for example. Or Tetris.""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/4ol7za/is_c_the_best_language_to_use_for_creation_of/""},{""id"":""4oh8dm"",""is_self"":false,""subreddit"":""slatestarcodex"",""author"":""michaelmf"",""score"":21,""num_comments"":15,""permalink"":""/r/slatestarcodex/comments/4oh8dm/the_disadvantages_of_being_stupid/"",""created_utc"":1466132660,""title"":""The Disadvantages of Being Stupid"",""url"":""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/the-war-on-stupid-people/485618/"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4n3qum"",""link_id"":""t3_4oh8dm"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":2,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466822851,""body"":""As shown by the lack of increased returns to intelligence over the past century: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11926851""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/4oh8dm/the_disadvantages_of_being_stupid/""},{""id"":""4oftkr"",""is_self"":true,""subreddit"":""csharp"",""author"":""SuperImaginativeName"",""score"":44,""num_comments"":34,""permalink"":""/r/csharp/comments/4oftkr/ive_been_using_c_for_about_3_years_is_it_bad_ive/"",""created_utc"":1466113038,""title"":""I've been using C# for about 3 years; is it bad I've basically never used inheritance apart from abstract class inheritance?"",""url"":""https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/4oftkr/ive_been_using_c_for_about_3_years_is_it_bad_ive/"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4cu0bj"",""link_id"":""t3_4oftkr"",""author"":""The_Amp_Walrus"",""score"":4,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466156396,""body"":""This is just me having a crack, but I think you would do something like this with dependency injection:\n  \n    class KungFuFighter\n    {\n        ILogger _logger; // to be injected\n        IKungFuRepository _kungFuRepository; // to be injected\n        \n        public KungFuFighter(ILogger logger, IKungFuRepository kungFuRepository)\n        {\n            // Dependency injection gives us the objects we need, plug them into the class\n            _logger = logger;\n            _kungFuRepository = kungFuRepository;\n        }\n\n        public void YellBattleCry()\n        {\n            string battleCry = _kungFuRepository.GetBattleCry();\n            Console.Log(battleCry+\""!\"");\n            _logger.Log(\""Kung Fu Fighter yelled battle cry \""+battleCry);\n        }\n    }\n\nDid I do it right?""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/4oftkr/ive_been_using_c_for_about_3_years_is_it_bad_ive/""},{""id"":""4o04uq"",""is_self"":true,""subreddit"":""cscareerquestions"",""author"":""csguy321"",""score"":2,""num_comments"":6,""permalink"":""/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4o04uq/how_to_prepare_for_a_fulltime_swe_job_as_a_new/"",""created_utc"":1465885823,""title"":""How to prepare for a full-time SWE job as a new graduate"",""url"":""https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4o04uq/how_to_prepare_for_a_fulltime_swe_job_as_a_new/"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d48jyy6"",""link_id"":""t3_4o04uq"",""author"":""The_Amp_Walrus"",""score"":4,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1465898367,""body"":""If you haven't already, you can have a  play around with branching and merging with git (assuming git at work): make some branches, make a merge conflict, fix the merge conflict.\n    \nIf you're interested in deployment and continuous integration you could check out (puppet or chef) and jenkins.

A parabola is convex. A U shape is convex. A W shape is not convex because the peak in the middle blocks the line of sight.\n  \nMachine learning models usually try to reduce a given problem to the problem of finding the lowest point on a surface. When you choose a set of weights you will get an error number that describes how well your model performs. If you explore all the possible weights you will traverse an error surface. You are trying to minimize your error. It is like you are trying to find the lowest point in some terrain, like trying to find the valley floor in a mountain range. The problem is that you don't know exactly what the whole error surface looks like, and the challenge is to efficiently find the lowest point.\n  \nIf the error surface is convex then you are guaranteed to eventually find the bottom if you follow the slope downwards. A ball rolling down a U shape will always find the bottom. If the error surface is not convex then you might not find the lowest (and best) point. You might get stuck in a rut. Gradient descent is a method of following the slope of the error surface to the bottom.""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4nvvbp/developer_for_10_years_want_to_transition_to/""},{""id"":""4nm25g"",""is_self"":false,""subreddit"":""DataHoarder"",""author"":""arcq"",""score"":104,""num_comments"":197,""permalink"":""/r/DataHoarder/comments/4nm25g/coursera_shuts_access_to_old_platform_courses/"",""created_utc"":1465662431,""title"":""Coursera shuts access to old platform courses - Time to archive courses..."",""url"":""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11881767"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4dqyal"",""link_id"":""t3_4nm25g"",""author"":""The_Amp_Walrus"",""score"":0,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1466208717,""body"":""RemindMe! 48 Hours\n""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/4nm25g/coursera_shuts_access_to_old_platform_courses/""},{""id"":""4min3w"",""is_self"":false,""subreddit"":""SilkRoad"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":10,""num_comments"":4,""permalink"":""/r/SilkRoad/comments/4min3w/sr2_staffer_doctorclu_sentenced_to_8_years/"",""created_utc"":1465052317,""title"":""SR2 staffer DoctorClu sentenced to 8 years"",""url"":""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2852008/Farrell-Sentence.pdf"",""comments"":[{""id"":""d4rgapv"",""link_id"":""t3_4min3w"",""author"":""gwern"",""score"":1,""downs"":0,""created_utc"":1467135480,""body"":""It was almost certainly the now-infamous CMU CERT Blackhat traffic-analysis attack which de-anonymized the ~70 IPs that included Farrell's while accessing the SR2 vendor onion.""}],""Url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/4min3w/sr2_staffer_doctorclu_sentenced_to_8_years/""}]}";
